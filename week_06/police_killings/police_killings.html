    <h1>People killed in 2015 by police officers</h1>
    <p> The dataset used for this analysis includes features sucha as gender, race, date, city, state, manner of death, if they were armed, 
      if they have a mental illness or if they flee.
    </p><br>
    <h2>Age distribution</h2>
    <div id="histogram"></div>
    <p> I chose to use this graph to see if there was a relationship between the age group
      and the killings. Effectively, we can see that the ages of most of the people killed ranges between
      20 and 40 years old. Understanding why this groups are more vulnerable to this fatal destinies
      is vital to come to better solutions.
      Some complementary information would be the demograpgic age distribution, to disccount that effect.
    </p><br>
    <h2>Killings by race</h2>
    <div id="horizontal-chart" class="flex-item"></div>
    <p> Then, I decided to use this graph to see the amount of people killed by race.
      This graph can be misleading. As some people might interpret that white people is more
      vulnerable to be killed by the police. However, to understand the whole picture is 
      necessary to compare it to the proportions of people of these groups. That way, we will
      see if some groups are more vulnerable than others.
    </p><br>
    <h2>Mental illness proportion</h2>
    <div id="chart" class="ring"></div>
    <p> Finally, I chose this aggregations of the data as it is unusual to know in police killings
      any informations regarding mental illnesses. I was sorprised by the amount of people 
      with a mental illness involved in this type of incidents. To get a better understanding of
      this data it would be very important to know what kind of mental illnesses are considered, so
      we can see if there are some that make people particularly more vulnerable
