### Description of data:
Quarterly House Price Index by region within countries.

### Why you are interested in this topic?
Housing is a necesity that has become really hard to achieve due to increases in house prices.I want to give a worldwide outlook of this matter. To give a better perspective I wanna incoporate other data like income, cost of living, well-being, or environmental risks (still thinking about which ones, also OECD data). Let's see if it's worth what we are paying for housing.

### Thoughts on how you would hope to use this data
I would like to make some visualizations usings worldwide maps and heatmaps, but also I'd like to explore other ways to show this type of information. Also, I will try to present some metrics in a more human way that represent how people is affected by these issues. Try not just to show them like plain numbers.

### Potential data points
Cities, house prices, income, cost of living, temperature, water availability, and air quality.

### Any concerns about the data
There might be some correlations or missing variables that play against my analysis. Also, I hope I can homologate the data for all the places that I am considering.

### Identify if source is primary or secondary
My source is primary. They gather the data directly from countries' agencies.

### If secondary data, how you envision this data working with the primary source?
NA
