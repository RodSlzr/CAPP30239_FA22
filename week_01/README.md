I am a second-year CAPP student. I'm 27 years old, and I come from Mexico. Before grad school, I worked as a financial analyst at the Central Bank of Mexico for four years. With my new skills at UChicago, I want to shift my career toward Data Science. I'm considering looking for opportunities in different industries like consulting, finance, and tech.
